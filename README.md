# Module 22 of The Complete Web Development Bootcamp:

This is the ToDoList app. It combines Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, and EJS templates/partials.

I'll be honest: Module 22 of Angela Yu's course was a bit soporific for me. Nothing against her or the course. Maybe it's that I don't love EJS too much or maybe it's just that ToDoList apps aren't totally exciting.

But I needed to do another Git push, so here you go.

On the other hand, and on a more positive note, I'm actually quite enjoying Module 23. It's still EJS, but I think the fact that it's organized as challenges makes it a bit more exciting. I'm having fun solving the challenges independently. Look forward to another Git push soon.
